* Tasks are to be delegated during the weekly meetings being held on Fridays, 4:00PM to 5:00PM. 
* The previous week's work should be completed by the time the sprint is done (the following Friday), any bugs/blockers withstanding.
* Every feature should be developed in their own branch, with pull requests requiring reviews and approval from fellow team members.
* Documentation for this project will be written in Markdown and located in the /docs folder, as there is no Wiki available for this type of repository.

### Game Summary
_Paving the Way_ is an exciting first-person 3D strategic running game. The aim of this game is to survive each timed level by making it to a goal point at the end of each map. Equipped with a gun that fires out blocks to aid your quest, you must use your allocated amount of blocks wisely to pave a path towards the end goal, whilst collecting coins to improve your character's abilities. It is currently playable in two modes: levelled and endless.

### Technologies
Project is created with:
* Unity 2022.1.9f1 
* Ipsum version: 2.33
* Ament library version: 999

### Code Snippets 

You may wish to include code snippets, but be sure to explain them properly, and don't go overboard copying
every line of code in your project!

```c#
public class CameraController : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start ()
    {
        // Do something...
    }
}
```
